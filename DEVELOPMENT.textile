h3. Developing for Common Content

To get started developing for (CC) you will need at least a command-line git client.  
You can download a command-line git client for Windows here -> http://git-scm.com/downloads

On OSX you should install git using homebrew or your package manager of choice.

Once you have git you can clone the (CC) codebase using the following command...
    
    > git clone https://github.com/johnsinco/common-content.git

Then cd to the created common-content directory and perform a `bundle` install

h3.  Specs

(CC) uses rspec-rails as the testing framework.  You can execute the specs using simply `rspec`

h3. Dummy Project

Rails engine plugins use a built-in 'dummy' app for integration testing in the local environment. 
In order to run the dummy app you should `cd spec/dummy` then `rails s` to run.  The (CC) app is 
below the '/contents' path in the dummy app ala 'http://localhost:3000/contents'
